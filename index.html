<font face="ironman" colors="grey" size="5"><b>DESCRIPTION:</b>A stand-alone Senior High School
(SHS) is a secondary school that operates independently from a Junior High School (JHS) or
Integrated School (IS). It has its own distinct location and a separate school head 
(p0rincipal). This contrasts with Integrated SHS, which is located within an existing JHS or
IS and shares the same school head. 
Essentially, a stand-alone Senior High School is a separate institution specifically
dedicated to Grades 11 and 12, the final two years of the K to 12 program in the Philippines.
It offers specialized upper secondary education based on the chosen tracks and strands. 
Here's a breakdown:
stand-alone:
A senior high school with its own campus and principal, seperate from any other school,
integrated:
A senior high school within an existing junior high school or integrated, sharing the
same principal.</font>
